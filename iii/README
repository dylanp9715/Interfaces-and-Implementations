Dylan Park and Kira Lauring

We would personally like to thank Iris, Harper, Emily, and Diana who were 
extremely helpful in helping us complete this project. By ensuring that we knew
what the spec required of us as well as what our code was doing line by line, 
they guided us on the necessary path to find our own bugs.

Everything should be implemented correctly.

We spent approximately 40 hours on this project.
